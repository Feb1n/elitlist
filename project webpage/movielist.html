    <div id="text2">
        For my project I am aiming to make a program that helps users keep track of the TV shows and movies that they are watching. This program would create lists for users, separated into watched, watching and planning to watch, where they could track the number of episodes they watched, give the show a personal rating, track their statistics or get recommendations from the program based on the genres they like and also based on the shows that other users on the system have watched.
